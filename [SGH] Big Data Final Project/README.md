# [SGH] Big Data Final Project
- This is my Big Data subjectâ€™s final project at SGH Warsaw School of Economics
- It was done on databricks community version
- The dataset used in the project is also attached in this repository

# Project Description
**Predicting Customer Churn Using Multilayer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier).**

**Objective:** Predict customer churn using deep learning with PySpark's Multilayer Perceptron Classifier.

**Process:**
- Use a customer dataset with features like usage behavior, demographics, and subscription details.
- Preprocess the data: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- Train an MLPClassifier using labeled data where churn is the target variable.
- Experiment with different network architectures (e.g., number of hidden layers and neurons) to optimize the model.

**Evaluation:**
- Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the classifier.
- Plot a confusion matrix and ROC curve to assess model performance.
- Document the effect of changing MLP hyperparameters on the results.
