# Credit Scoring - Automation Business Process Final Project

## Project Description
The project focuses on developing credit scoring models and understanding the challenges of their real-world implementation. Through hands-on experience, I have explored how rejected applications significantly impact model performance and decision-making.

One of the key takeaways from this project is learning how financial indicators shape decision engine rules within the acceptance process, which includes two major components:
- Acquisition: Instalment Loan
- Cross-Selling: Cash Loan

By building a fully automated process where credit decisions are driven entirely by predictive models, I gained valuable insights into the future of financial decision-making. This project has enhanced my ability to configure, optimize, and maintain automated credit scoring systems

## Project Process
The project contains 3 main parts:
- The initial strategy which denied obvious BAD customers so that the models will have the chance to differentiate GOOD customers and "GREY" customers
- Building 4 predictive models on:
  - Probability of default of customers who use the Installment Loan product
  - Probability of default of customers who use the Cash Loan product
  - Probability of default of customers who use the Cash Loan product when using an Installment Loan product
  - Probability of response (Marketing model)
- Define strategy, setting cut-off points

## Objective
The goal of the project is to build an optimal strategy for the loan approval process, in order to maximize final profit on both products in the 1975-1987 period, as well as maintain the reasonable acceptance rate for both products.
