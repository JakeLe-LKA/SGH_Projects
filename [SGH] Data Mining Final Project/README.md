# SGH_Data_Mining_Final_Project
- This is my Data Mining subject’s final project at SGH Warsaw School of Economics
- The project is done using Python with Jupyter Notebook
- The dataset used in the project is also attached in this repository

# Project Description
**Objective:**
- Using 2 predictive models (Logistic Regression and Decision Tree) to predict Bank’s customers subscription
- Find out which demographic and campaign-related factors are most influential in determining whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit

**Process:**
- Use a customer dataset with features like usage behavior, demographics, and subscription details
- Preprocess the data: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features
- Train and optimize the two models

**Evaluation:**
- Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC to evaluate the classifier
